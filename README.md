# Weather Forecast Dashboard

## Description

The objective of this project is to create a weather dashboard that seamlessly runs in the browser and employs dynamically updated HTML and CSS for an enhanced user experience. The focus of this project is on harnessing the power of third-party APIs, specifically the OpenWeatherMap API, to retrieve and display weather data for citie in real time.  

    1. Users are able to search for a city and the web application will display the current and future forecasts. This search is then saved in the user's search history.
    2. The forecasts will display the city's name, date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon related to predicted weather. 
    3. Users can click into their search history and be presented with current and future data for that city.  

 Third-party APIs play a pivotal role in the realm of software development, providing a gateway for developers to access external data, services, and functionalities seamlessly. These APIs, created and maintained by external entities, empower developers to integrate pre-built features into their applications, significantly reducing development time and effort. The importance of third-party APIs lies in their ability to expand the capabilities of an application by incorporating specialized services without the need for in-house development.Overall, third-party APIs are indispensable tools that contribute to the efficiency, scalability, and innovation of software development processes.
